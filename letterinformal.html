<p>Dear Samson,</p>
<p>I know i have wronged many ways. I would like if you can forgive all
my wrongs doings.Though most of the things that that you were told are 
not the truth, I will explain in details myself.On 7th of march 2020 
when your grandfather kicked the bucket,I was sick to the extent i couldn't
eat by myself.The news of his death brought a great shock to me.You know how 
much i cherished him,i was depressed also after hearing the news.During the time
i was hospitalized,i was not allow to use my phone all through,I would have given 
you a call. I sent my regards through my parents.Unfortunately when they came,
you were not around.They couldn't deliver the message to you .i was relieved a little
after your grandfather had been buried but my parents still insist that i should stay 
in the hospital for some days.i then realised that my chance of living here to meet u is 
infinitesimal.On 15th of April,i was discharged then i quickly rushed down to your house 
but i was told you left with your aunt to port-harcourt.I broke down in tears.I cried myself out.
I am very sorry i could not reach you and be there for you when you need me most.Where i made the mistake
is that i should have write a letter to you about my current condition,I am sorry once again.
Don't hate me, Please.I am not so that heartless to behave in such manner<br>
I couldn't greet you first because i have a lot in mind.How are you doing? Hope you are doing so good.I am 
very happy when i was told you aunt gave birth to twins this month.I don't know when you will come back home but 
i will wait for you to come back and gist.I miss you alot dear.My regards to your aunt and her kids.Stay safe.Bye.
<p style="text-align: right;">Yours sincerely,<br>Leonard</p>
